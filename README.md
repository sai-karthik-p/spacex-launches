*   The User can view the details of the launch on a modal
*   The User can filter and see upcoming and past launches
*   The User can filter based on if the launch was successful
*   The application has an empty state and loading state indicator
*   After applying the filter the URL changes so that if the user copies the URL and sends it to a friend then the friend can see the data with the filter applied. In other words when the page is refreshed then the filter will not be removed
